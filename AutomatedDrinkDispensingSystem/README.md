This repository contains the code for the main application of my senior
design project. It's written for **Python 3.6**, and it uses non-standard
libraries, like *cryptography*, *gpizero*, and *pillow*.

The master branch is the final version of the code, which is meant for
the Raspbian OS on a Raspberry Pi. The windows_branch is the previous version of the code,
which was written on a Windows 10 computer. The windows_branch will be retained for testing purposes.

The MainApp.py is the entry point for the GUI application. There are a few
command line arguments that can be supplied to enable/disable peripheral
devices. Some of the shell scripts located in this directory were made
to lessen the amount of typing when it comes to the providing command line
arguments.

The test code directory contains code that was used in order to develop
the main source code.
